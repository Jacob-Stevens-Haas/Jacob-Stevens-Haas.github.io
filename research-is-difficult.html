</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It takes years of training and mentorship to understand the industry, learn what's important in a field, how to organize a team, how to plan and forecast research, what combination of activities produce research, and how that research earns the currency of the realm, both financial and social.
I still don't claim to have a handle on all of that and admit I've been slow to learn.  But the picture is starting to take shape in the final year of my PhD.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll blog later about the other aspects mentioned above, but now I want to focus on just one of those activities: experimentation.
It's no secret that a lot of applied mathematics papers focus on showing a method can be useful without thorough proofs on the distribution of problem class (for an example that does, see <a class="reference external" href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/090771806">HMT</a> ).
And that's _fine_.
So long as methods are well-tested, the empirical approach can and should convince people, and convincing people is one of the currencies of the realm.</p>
<p>I'd like to put together my thoughts on what makes experiments good and convincing.
The basic point is &quot;engineering and collaboration&quot;, but how we get there is interesting on it's own merits.ls</p>
