Welcome to my website.
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Mathematics at University of Washington.
I study machine learning and stochastic processes with the aim to identify differential equations in physics, climate, and biology.
In the past, I have built and contributed to open and closed-source software projects on maintenenance/obsolescence forecasting, underwater acoustic machine learning, and network interdiction.

I used to serve in the Navy as a Surface Warfare Officer, deploying four times to the Western Pacific and Middle East.  I also enjoy skiing and global politics and play ice hockey for the Pheasants.
