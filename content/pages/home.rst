  :alt: A picture of me, working for Volt

I recently completed a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at University of Washington,
where I studied machine learning for differential equations.
I went a-rusticating for a few months, but now I'm back maintaining pysindy,
contributing to other open-source software projects,
and looking for work.
In the past I've build ML tools for maintenenance/obsolescence forecasting,
underwater acoustic detection and classification,
and network interdiction.

I used to drive ships in the US Navy,
deploying four times to the Western Pacific and Middle East.
I also enjoy skiing, history and playing ice hockey for the Pheasants and Narwhals in my local league.
