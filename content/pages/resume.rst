Summary
-------

- Recently returning to industry after my Ph.D.
- Research in ML of physics, stochastics, and research engineering;
  experience with LLMs and RL
- Lead maintainer of pysindy,
  a python ML package with 1.6k stars on github and hundreds of users globally
- Prior professional experience leading data science
  and computer vision/listening projects for consulting clients.
- Teamwork and leadership experience through seven years of Naval service
  in high-stakes environments.

Professional Experience
------------------------------------


- Booz Allen Hamilton, Lead Scientist (*Sep 2018—Sep 2021*)

  - Let a 5-engineer/statistician team to build time-series forecasting
    for mine-detection logistics,
    5-50% planning accuracy improvement
    and secured multi-year contract renewal;
    designed experiments and automated statistical analysis,
    ran Agile, owned stakeholder and technical roadmap;
    stack: Python, scikit-learn, statsmodels

  - Led a Machine Learning research effort to detect and track vessels from
    classified submarine acoustic recordings.
    Built unclassified effort, project Baya, to disseminate capability
    to company and published results in conference.

- U.S. Navy — Lieutenant (*May 2011 — November 2017*)

  - Lead operation planning for 10+ ship international exercises.
    Planned and oversaw humanitarian deployment Pacific Partnership 2015
    and fleet exercises.
  - Directed operations on Nimitz Strike Group in the Arabian Gulf,
    lead bridge team responsible for safe navigation in critical situations,
    and managed safe engineering plant operation across four deployments.

Education
---------

- Ph.D., Applied Mathematics — University of Washington, *2025*

  - Led (& currently lead) pysindy, an ML library for learning dynamical
    systems with 1600+ stars on github and dozens of collaborating researchers
    and engineers throughout development lifecycle. Managed long-term
    engineering and scientific priorities and experiment design, reviewed
    PRs & implemented cutting edge methods around
    reinforcement learning, convex optimization, stochastic processes;
    Package used for studying metabolic processes, HVAC
    engineering, fusion reactor design, molecular angles, and more.
    stack: jax, scikit-learn, numpyro, gurobi, sympy, numpy, cvxpy and more.
  - Reproduced LLM learning experiments from recent papers,
    implementing transformer networks in pytorch
    and evaluating model performance and training dynamics.
  - Derived and demonstrated stochastic (Kalman-like) smoothing filter
    for Doppler sonar data from seagliders.
    Built and evaluated neural and statistical time-series models
    for reduced-order systems of fluid flows.
  - Organized collaboration across several groups,
    including open source contributions of an experiment runner
    and production-quality features/bugfixes to numpy, matplotlib, pandas.
    Mentored peers and improved team dynamics to speed up and
    deliver research projects confidently.

- B.S., Quantitative Economics/minor in Arabic, *with honors*
  — United States Naval Academy, *2011*
